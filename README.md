#Simple Alphabetize Function

An example of using JavaScript to make a function that alphabetizes array objects by a specific key value and then renders them to the screen with the rest of the object data.

Uses sort() method to arrange the objects alphabetically (in this example by the "name" key), then map() to make a new array putting the data into HTML tags, and finally join() with an empty string passed in to remove the commas between array objects.

A working example can be seen on CodePen [here](http://codepen.io/danbuda/pen/qqBdbx).
